Obs 1 : 
	a. Root Node : 
			1. On serial monitor : Gets messages from all the leaf nodes. 

	b. Leaf Node : 
			1. On serial monitor : Gets messages from all other the leaf nodes.
			2. On serial monitor : Recieves correctly from the published messages to the topic painlessMesh/to/broadcast
			3. On serial monitor : Recieves correctly from the published messages to the topic painlessMesh/to/<own node id>  
			4. On serial monitor : Does not recieve from the published messages to the topic painlessMesh/to/<other node ids>

Conclusion : All the leaf nodes and root nodes are working with channel 6 and seems to be working correct

Conclusion : 	The intial settling period is little bit more as the leaf nodes seems to be scannning and getting 
		aligned to the channel of the root node i.e. 6. But once done all the operations are running OK.
		If a node gets reset it may take more time to get aligned to the other nodes channel.

Conclusion : 	The root node seems to be running on channel 6 by default [ assuming by seeing the following log on root]

		CONNECTION: scanComplete(): Scan finished
		CONNECTION: scanComplete():-- > Cleared old APs.
		CONNECTION: scanComplete(): num = 6


		NOT SURE IF THE MESSAGE ABOVE STATES THE CHANNEL NUMBER

		The intial settling period is little bit more as the leaf nodes seems to be scannning and getting 
		aligned to the channel of the root node. But once done all the operations are running OK.
		If a node gets reset it may take more time to get aligned to the other nodes channel.

Conclusion : 	The root node state intially channel 8 but then shifts to channel 6. And then the leaf nodes



		CONNECTION: scanComplete(): Scan finished
		CONNECTION: scanComplete():-- > Cleared old APs.
		CONNECTION: scanComplete(): num = 8
		....
		....
		....

		CONNECTION: scanComplete(): Scan finished
		CONNECTION: scanComplete():-- > Cleared old APs.
		CONNECTION: scanComplete(): num = 6

		NOT SURE IF THE MESSAGE ABOVE STATES THE CHANNEL NUMBER

		aligned to the channel of the root node. But once done all the operations are running OK.
		If a node gets reset it may take more time to get aligned to the other nodes channel.

MAJOR : It seems if the leaf nodes know that there is a root in the node , it seems they align their Wifi channel to 
	that of the root node.
